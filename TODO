=== Required ===
[ ] "Just launched page" improvements
   [ ] remove confusing "you already launched an instance"  message
       on first launch. Replace with "reload this page in a few min"
   [ ] in the case where 'terminated' (already done), give better data
   [ ] remove mention of email
[ ] More info on what to do
[ ] Provide flat "You need to setup an SSH key, with instructions"
[ ] Add a 'please set my password' button. that uses ssh to
    chpasswd && passwd -l && show user password
[X] roll over to new regions when you receive 
    This is basically required for us.  The canonical account limits are:
      us-east-1:      150 instances
      us-west-1:      50
      eu-west-1:      50
      ap-southeast-1: 50
    [X] insufficient capacity (InsufficientInstanceCapacity)
    [X] account reached limit (error_code='InstanceLimitExceeded')

=== Want ===
[X] 'bybobu me'
   [X] button on runit
   [X] modification of user data to enable
       (run-cmd) byobu-launcher-install
[ ] add logging (remove smoser's import sys; sys.stderr.write())
[X] "config" info persisted in db
    description file associated with config
[X] config: wordpress [Andreas]
    [X] add a file in /home/ubuntu/README - not needed
    [X] add a link at (or redirect) at http://<host>/ to <host>/blog
[X] config: moinmoin [Andreas]
    [X] add a file in /home/ubuntu/README - not needed
    [X] add a link at (or redirect) so that http://<host>/ works

=== Nice to have ===
[ ] ajax instance page launch page state "live" updates
[ ] launchpad required group membership per campaign

=== Version 2.0 ===
[ ] Many of the constants in settings could be made campaign specific
[ ] Domain name
   [ ] Consider "short version".. and redirect to $shortversion.ubuntu.com
   [ ] Get SSO whitelist
[ ] Extend User model, perhaps adding "hass_ssh_ boolean
[ ] better feedback form handle multiple 'submits' by a single user

=== Done ===
[X] database changes
   [X] remove instance status
   [X] add console initial
   [X] add console final
   [X] add hostname
   [X] add ipv4 address
[X] Actually terminate instances in aws_poll (or potentially other script)
[X] user data
   add 'at' jobs (schedule-warnings)
     [X] to shut down (failsafe only)
     [X] wall 10 minutes
     [X] wall  5 minutes
     [X] wall  1 minutes
   [X] write message to console on first user login (log-first-login)
[X] user data selection on button page
[X] console log collection
   probably want a separate crawler (console_poll) for this, as it would
   likely slow down the main one, which does the rest of what we want
   [X] database modification to store console logs (initial, and final)
   [X] 4 minutes after start
   [X] first notice of termination
[X] Populate model details:
   [X] IP address
   [X] EC2 Hostname
   [X] Console Start
   [X] Console End
[X] addressed 'stopped' state somehow.
    currently, this just largely ignores 'stopped'.  The system
    would stay in a stopped state for the normal alotted time, and then
    be terminated (basically stopped == running)
[X] ssh public keys collection
    Before we can suggest that a user connect via ssh, we really should
    give them ssh fingerprints.
    - insert a "call home" call in user data, so system calls when reachable.
[X] RT ticket for domain name (and hosting)
