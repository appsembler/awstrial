== Running tests ==

Run tests with::

  python manage.py test trial 

Here are items that need to be tested:

 0. Turn off debugging in the local settings file
 1. Home page shows up fine
   a. If a campaign is active, a campaign button should appear
   b. If no campaign is active, no button should appear
 2. When clicking a campaign button you should be taken to SSO, not 
    not launchpad login
 3. Launch an instance with each option using a SSO account with a 
    launchpad association (username and SSH key) ensuring each runs
    properly
    * You can trigger an instance to terminate early by changing the 
      "Spawn" time back an hour and then waiting for a minute until the
      cron task terminates it.
    * Once terminated, you can delete it to create a new instance
 4. Launch an instance with "base install" option using a SSO account 
    without a launchpad association (no username, no SSH key) ensuring 
    that you are able to connect to the instance and that you're prompted
    for a password
